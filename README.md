# Daily-Message-Python
This is a message of the day app written in python, displaying in a terminal window and retrieving messages from a text file
I used this app as a secret admirer/love letter message app every morning for someone special.
I simply placed this in the startup directory of the windows machine. 


To use, Simply populate Messages.txt with you message in the following format:
dd/mm/yyyy_<message> 
The program uses the _ as a delimiter, I found this easier as comma may be used in messages.

You may also view the previous day's message by typing yesterday followed by <ENTER>

TODO:
Functionality to generate dates.
Enter Messages consecutively in the app.
Encryption as my someone special may accidentally open the messages.txt
